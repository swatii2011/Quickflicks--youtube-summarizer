Machine learning is a lot more than just learning. It's also about understanding and reasoning.
Today, we will learn about the basics of machine learning.
Humans learn from past experiences, and machines follow instructions. But if we train machines on past data, they can learn and act faster.
Machine learning builds predictive models from data and improves as more data is fed in.
There are three main types of machine learning: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
Machine learning is widely used in healthcare, fraud detection, social media analysis, and e-commerce.
